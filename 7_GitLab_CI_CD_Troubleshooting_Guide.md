# Troubleshooting and Common Issues in GitLab CI/CD

## Understanding Pipeline Failures

### Real-Life Examples:

1. **Failed Jobs**:
   - Example: A pipeline job fails due to a missing package in the test environment.
     Solution: Add the missing package installation command in the `before_script` section of the .gitlab-ci.yml.

2. **Timeouts**:
   - Example: A deployment job times out while waiting for a service to start.
     Solution: Increase the job's timeout setting in the GitLab CI/CD configuration or optimize the startup script.

3. **Runner Issues**:
   - Example: A job is stuck in a pending state because there are no available runners tagged with `linux`.
     Solution: Ensure runners with the appropriate tags are available and online, or adjust the job's `tags` setting.

## Debugging Scripts in CI Pipelines

### Real-Life Examples:

1. **Using echo Statements**:
   - Example: Uncertain why a variable isn't being set correctly.
     Solution: Add `echo "Variable value: $VARIABLE_NAME"` to the script to output the variable's current value.

2. **Reviewing Artifacts**:
   - Example: Tests pass locally but fail in the pipeline.
     Solution: Collect test output as artifacts and review them for differences or errors not present locally.

3. **Manual Job Triggering**:
   - Example: A job behaves differently when triggered by a merge request compared to manual triggering.
     Solution: Manually trigger the job from the GitLab interface and compare the environments and outputs.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Real-Life Examples:

1. **Misconfigured .gitlab-ci.yml**:
   - Example: A pipeline doesn't trigger on push to a feature branch.
     Solution: Check the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file for correct usage of `only` and `except` keywords with branch patterns.

2. **Incorrect Branch Configurations**:
   - Example: Deployment jobs run on every push, not just on the main branch.
     Solution: Adjust the `only` keyword to specify the main branch for deployment jobs.

3. **Dependency Problems**:
   - Example: A build job fails because a dependency specified in `package.json` is not available.
     Solution: Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed and accessible, and that package repositories are up to date.

4. **Environment Variable Misuse**:
   - Example: A script fails because it relies on an environment variable that isn't set.
     Solution: Set the required environment variables in the GitLab CI/CD settings and ensure they're passed correctly.

5. **Cache Problems**:
   - Example: Build times are inconsistent, sometimes fast and sometimes slow.
     Solution: Configure caching properly in `.gitlab-ci.yml` to ensure dependencies are reused across runs.

6. **Docker and Container Issues**:
   - Example: A job fails because the Docker image cannot be pulled.
     Solution: Check the image name for typos, ensure access rights to the Docker registry, and verify network connectivity.

## Advanced Debugging Techniques

### Real-Life Examples:

1. **CI/CD Debug Tracing**:
   - Example: A job fails without clear error messages.
     Solution: Enable CI/CD debug tracing in the project settings for more detailed logs.

2. **Local Pipeline Testing**:
   - Example: A complex pipeline works on one project but not another.
     Solution: Use GitLab Runner locally to test the pipeline in an isolated environment and compare configurations.

3. **Third-Party Tools**:
   - Example: Need to track down where time is being spent in your build process.
     Solution: Integrate a performance monitoring tool into your pipeline to identify slow steps.

## Best Practices for Avoiding Common Issues

### Real-Life Examples:

1. **Keep Scripts Simple and Modular**:
   - Example: A complex script is hard to debug.
     Solution: Break down the script into smaller, focused scripts that are easier to manage and debug.

2. **Document Your CI/CD Process**:
   - Example: New team members are having difficulty understanding the pipeline.
     Solution: Create documentation that explains each stage of the pipeline and how to troubleshoot common problems.

3. **Regularly Review and Update Pipelines**:
   - Example: An outdated pipeline is causing failures because it references deprecated services.
     Solution: Periodically review and update pipelines to ensure they use current practices and tools.

4. **Engage with the Community**:
   - Example: Stumped by a pipeline configuration issue.
     Solution: Seek advice and solutions by posting detailed questions in GitLabâ€™s community forums or Stack Overflow.

5. **Automate and Test**:
   - Example: A script works locally but fails in the pipeline.
     Solution: Write tests for your scripts and run them locally and as part of your CI process to catch issues early.
